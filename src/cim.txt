the IO thread records changes: ID, what to change, value | In some sort of queue
which we try and consume every single frame on the main thread. Can we give the ptr?
Uhm, might be unsafe, because we probably want to resize the hashmap?? Still unsure
how the hashmap works anyway...

style_update_queue
{
    style_update *Buffer;
    Size, Cap;

    Rolling buffer...? Ya, Entries to process... Then it's like: how do we know what 
    changed exactly such that we process only the entries that have changed. Could
    do a full copy for now?
}

======================================================================================

Do we build the rect every frame in the button code? It's pretty ugly and somewhat
expensive 'probably' with all this pointer chasing, we probably shouldn't touch
that memory. Can store it. But it's like... Why not store the rect directly??
