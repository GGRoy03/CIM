TASK:
x) Think about how we actually want to allocate our memory.
x) Replace STD functions.
x) Add more styling/components.
x) Think about the threading thing we do badly.
x) Animation API.
x) Text rendering

BUGS:
-VSync causes a lot of problems with the inputs. For example, when dragging the
|graphics can run {-NumOfBackBuffers} frames behind the mouse causing a weird thing
|where the object being dragged doesn't feel good. Disabling V-Sync fixes all of this,
|but it's not a good solution to force on the user.

THOUGHTS:
Text rendering is kicking my ass. I need to start simple. Just look at how I did it for JANI and start simple.
I don't think we use D2D? It forces some weird dependency between the platform and the renderer and doesn't seem
that useful. Just use DWrite on windows. Go for the texture atlas method. I don't know. It seems like DWrite
uses Direct2D so I might be forced? I know ImGui doesn't handle complex texts, but I want to. It feels a bit overwhelming.
Not sure what to do. So what? We are forced to use DirectWrite on Windows -> Which uses D2D and then creates that dependency.
Feels overwhelming. Maybe need more research. It seems so simple. Maybe I drop refterm code for now? Idk.
