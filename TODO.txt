TASK:
x) Improvements to how we store the points. (4 floats instead of 8?)
x) Styling API
x) Layout (Store components as a N..Many tree)
x) Overall clean-ups (Code is very ugly in some parts)
x) Think about how we actually want to allocate our memory

BUGS:
-VSync causes a lot of problems with the inputs. For example, when dragging the
|graphics can run {-NumOfBackBuffers} frames behind the frame causing a weird thing
|where the thing being dragged doesn't feel good. Disabling V-Sync fixes all of this,
|but it's not a good solution to force on the user.
