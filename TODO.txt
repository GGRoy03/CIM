TASK:

x) Fix the data flow for the style thread.
x) Animation API

BUGS:
-VSync causes a lot of problems with the inputs. For example, when dragging the
|graphics can run {-NumOfBackBuffers} frames behind the mouse causing a weird thing
|where the object being dragged doesn't feel good. Disabling V-Sync fixes all of this,
|but it's not a good solution to force on the user.
